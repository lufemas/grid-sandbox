A _simple_ template for _simple_ html/css projects.


## Selectors

`*`: Applies to all elements

`type`: specify the element by its type (h1, h2, header, etc ) 

`.class`: Applying a reusable designation 

`#id`: A unique identifier 

`[attribute="value"]`: ,for instance _<code>[type="checkbox"]</code>_ 

## Project Rubrics

###Project Structure:
  - File naming ( no spaces, all small, appropriate for the content)
  - folder structure ( html at root, others are organized into named folder ) 
  - Images are named for SEO: _yellow-concrete-stairs.jpg_
  - Images are appropriately sized/compressed
  - README.md which includes an overview of the project and any addition important info
  - Frequent commits with strong messages

###CHTML best Practices:
  - Meta tags (and other `<head>` properties)
  - Indentation, organization of markup, spelling ( english )
  - Document outline (heading structure and block structure)
  - Semantic elements ( both block and inline)
  - Accessibility (ex: image alt tags)
  - Uniformity between pages

 ###Content Development:
  - Page structure ( header, main, footer) "JR's note: Use at least this three ones"
  - Navigation
  - Footer: terms of use, contact
  - Pages must link to each other
  - Logos link to index or root

 ###Styling (CSS):
  - Selecting appropriate font w/ fallback
  - Limiting colours ( by number and strength) "JR's note: Try not to use too much colors, some white bg is good"
  - Embellishments ( border lines, drop shadows) 
  - Using CSS variables to store common colours, fonts, values
  - Font/text: spacing is appropriate and consistent
